Curr issues:
  - useless_item ?id not colored in 'd' menu; works in 'r' & 'i' menus
  - didn't offer to pick up scarf of resistance; over +0 cloak
  - stop rest on "something misses " (your orc friend)
  - OTA for bardiche; wearing shield
  - not seeing enemy die message (from ally kills?)
  - rr_autosearch need to be persistent?
    - ss_prev_location too?
    - manual_swing_slot?
  - scrolls + artefacts both cyan in the $ menu
  - make manuals yellow or something
  - dont display "move to" hotkey if not safe()
  - unmute: you see here (entrance to the depths)
  - fm? Hell Knight w/ +4 war axe of flaming: rF1, 154hp+25mp
  - keeps re-picking up boomerangs (after restart?)
  - too many alerts for 2h battleaxe when wearing shield + training it
  - msg: "dropped below 35.0%%"
  - hotkey move to, is swallowing a key press? (maybe shift-dir?)
  - pan is exploring frame by frame
  - alert-monsters: += "draugr" in regex
  - cntl-e from hell, ends w weird msg
  - after shaft; ignore hell
  - new weapon egos

### crawl PRs / issues affecting BRC
Lua bugs:
- Didn't find any props for trap_sarcophagus=1
- coroutine not defined
- pan is using a travel delay often/

https://github.com/crawl/crawl/issues/4789 ->
  - drop_disables_autopickup blocks exclude-dropped.lua from working
  - crawl option cannot be toggled off
https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/4814 -> artificial cap on length blocks color-inscribe.lua
https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/4892 -> required for bread-swinger.lua
Shift-D drops both an item picked up with item:pickup(), and also the last picked up item.

### TODO - requiring crawl PR?
1. fully-recover:
  - Wait for allies to fully heal
  - Wait for ancestor respawn
1. Ancestor reappear; stop rest, but not explore
1. remove stat inscriptions and "~~DROP_ME" when dropping item (needs to inscribe items on floor)
1. colorize 'inscriptions' of artefacts (and 0.34's inscriptions of all items like scarf of resistance)
1. 0.34: Make use of explore_auto_rest_status to replace fully-recover.lua.
    (Issue: Trouble calling ready() after heal, before explore. Multiple annoyances when it's skipped.)
    (Maybe could fix with >1 ready() / turn... Try macro'ing: { WAIT, READY, EXPLORE }?)
1. Disable mouse click travel (on MacOS?) - ideally just prevent accidental movement from trackpad
1. Display realtime for speedrun config

### Won't do - random ideas
1. feature ready() hook takes optional bool to fire every ready() instead of every turn
1. BRC.mprf.color(msg, ...) and textf.color(msg, ...) that use string.format()
1. autorest starts w/autopickup (if inv not full)
1. level-specific fm ignores (eg vault warden on v:5)
1. disable basic jewellery pickup after configurable xl
