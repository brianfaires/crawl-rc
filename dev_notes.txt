### TODO
1. [0.34] Items get auto-"inscribed" now in resists menu (using new terse name)
1. [0.34] Arte items get extra inscriptions from autoinscribe.rc (need to add negative regex check)
1. [TEST] wield artefact; still get weapon alerts?  (seems like only if adding an unused hand)
1. [TEST] these needed?
  - ae ^= <potions? of attraction, <potions? of lignification, <potions? of mutation
  - ae ^= <scrolls? of immolation, <scrolls? of poison
1. [TEST] standalone features

### Watch for:
- Added remember_alert() to pickup

### crawl PRs / issues affecting BRC
https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/4892 -> required for bread-swinger.lua
https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/4814 -> remove cap on inscription colors
https://github.com/crawl/crawl/issues/4789 -> drop_disables_autopickup overrides exclude-dropped
resting statuses fails after 100 turns (blocks fully-recover.lua behavior)
Shift-D drops both an item picked up with item:pickup(), and also the last picked up item.

### TODO - requiring crawl PR?
1. fully-recover:
  - Wait for allies to fully heal
  - Wait for ancestor respawn
1. Ancestor reappear; stop rest, but not explore
1. remove stat inscriptions and "~~DROP_ME" when dropping item (needs to inscribe items on floor)
1. colorize inscriptions of artefacts (arte inscriptions aren't part of `item.inscription`)
1. 0.34: Make use of explore_auto_rest_status to replace fully-recover.lua.
    (Issue: Trouble calling ready() after heal, before explore. Multiple annoyances when it's skipped.)
    (Maybe could fix with >1 ready() / turn... Try macro'ing: { WAIT, READY, EXPLORE }?)
1. Disable mouse click travel (on MacOS?) - ideally just prevent accidental movement from trackpad
1. Display realtime for speedrun config

### Won't do - random ideas
1. feature ready() hook takes optional bool to fire every ready() instead of every turn
1. BRC.mprf.color(msg, ...) and textf.color(msg, ...) that use string.format()
1. autorest starts w/autopickup (if inv not full)
1. level-specific fm ignores (eg vault warden on v:5)
1. disable jewellery pickup after configurable xl

### Known issues / Design choices
1. Emojis load at startup based on BRC.Config.emojis; need a restart to change that setting
1. Coglin DPS calcs for non-wielded weapons evaluate as if swapping out primary weapon (for artefact stat changes)
