### 0.34 changes needed
1. Inventory slots changed: Can no longer use l-item.inslot() to reliably get an item?

### To do list
1. Add macro to save skill targets & CONFIG values (by race or race+class)
1. Write persistent data to c_persist after each level (to recover from crashes)
1. cleanup/reduce # of display.rc messages
1. On alert, prompt/offer to pickup item
1. On pickup, if safe(), offer to wear/wield item
1. On drop_inferior inscribe, if safe(), offer to drop item
1. Armour ego alerts: identify new egos or missing resistances (not just compared to cur inventory)
1. [BUG] Arte items get extra inscriptions from autoinscribe.rc (need to add negative regex check)

### TODO - requiring crawl PR?
1. Wait for allies to fully heal
1. Better colorizing of rF+, rC+, etc (needs to intercept msgs)
1. Bring back mute_swaps.lua - only show final inventory slots (needs to intercept msgs)
1. remove stat inscriptions and "~~DROP_ME" when dropping item (needs to inscribe items on floor)
1. colorize inscriptions of artefacts (arte inscriptions aren't part of `item.inscription`)
1. 0.34: Make use of explore_auto_rest_status to replace fully-recover.lua.
    (Issue: Trouble calling ready() after heal, before explore. Multiple annoyances when it's skipped.)
1. Disable mouse click travel (on MacOS?) - ideally just prevent accidental movement from trackpad

### Won't do - random ideas
1. autorest starts w/autopickup (if inv not full)
1. level-specific fm ignores (eg vault warden on v:5)
1. disable jewellery pickup after configurable xl
1. disable pickup/alert of basic items (jewellery only?) after artefact of same type

### Design choices / simplifications
1. Coglin DPS calcs for non-wielded weapons evaluate as if swapping out primary weapon (for artefact stat changes)
1. Poltergeist do not inscribe AC/EV deltas
