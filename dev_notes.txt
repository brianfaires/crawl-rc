### 0.34 changes needed
1. Items get auto-"inscribed" now in resists menu (using new terse name)
1. [BUG] Arte items get extra inscriptions from autoinscribe.rc (need to add negative regex check)

### To do list
1. dynamic-options: use dispatch tables, `join["Beogh"]()` and `abandon["Jiyva"]()`
1. Features:
  - Rebind cntl-E and low radius for fast orb run
    - (runrest_ignore_monster ^= .*:2) above X% HP
    - (runrest_ignore_monster ^= .*:3) above Y% HP
    - ... up to 6
1. Profile features:
  - Turncount:
    - show_game_time = false
    - disable autopickup
    - auto-print name+qty when gold or item comes into view that would have been picked up
    - Bread-swinger: https://github.com/gammafunk/dcss-rc/blob/master/speedrun_rest.lua
  - Speedrun:
    - Display realtime
1. Pull crawl version for compatibility / 0.33 support
1. In-game menu (change config, save settings, etc...)
1. Update all RC files to be lua and use crawl.setopt()

### crawl PRs / issues affecting BRC
https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/4814 -> remove cap on inscription colors
https://github.com/crawl/crawl/issues/4789 -> drop_disables_autopickup overrides exclude-dropped
resting statuses fails after 100 turns (blocks fully-recover.lua behavior)
Shift-D drops both an item picked up with item:pickup(), and also the last picked up item.

### TODO - requiring crawl PR?
1. Wait for allies to fully heal
1. Bring back mute_swaps.lua - only show final inventory slots (needs to intercept msgs)
1. remove stat inscriptions and "~~DROP_ME" when dropping item (needs to inscribe items on floor)
1. colorize inscriptions of artefacts (arte inscriptions aren't part of `item.inscription`)
1. 0.34: Make use of explore_auto_rest_status to replace fully-recover.lua.
    (Issue: Trouble calling ready() after heal, before explore. Multiple annoyances when it's skipped.)
    (Try macro'ing: { WAIT, READY, EXPLORE })
1. If ancestor dead, apply a negative status (so resting will wait for it)
1. Disable mouse click travel (on MacOS?) - ideally just prevent accidental movement from trackpad
1. Ancestor reappear; stop rest, but not explore

### Won't do - random ideas
1. feature ready() option to fire every turn, or every ready()
1. BRC.mprf.color(msg, ...) and textf.color(msg, ...) that use string.format()
1. autorest starts w/autopickup (if inv not full)
1. level-specific fm ignores (eg vault warden on v:5)
1. disable jewellery pickup after configurable xl

### Known issues / Design choices
1. Emojis load at startup based on BRC.Config.emojis; need a restart to change that setting
1. Coglin DPS calcs for non-wielded weapons evaluate as if swapping out primary weapon (for artefact stat changes)
