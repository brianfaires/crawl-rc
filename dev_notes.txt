### todos
- more/flash prompts as lua (to toggle w configs)

fully-recover:
- test using CMD_WAIT vs CMD_REST; only use wait when maxhp? (else redraws every turn)

announce-items:
  - tomb, hell, other vaults: multiple gold piles
  - disable gold in extended?
  - keep track of items on cur level?

- features:
  - enter a "god of choice": FM on altar; hotkey move to
  - helper for selecting char tile?


### crawl PRs / issues affecting BRC
Lua bugs:
- Didn't find any props for trap_sarcophagus=1
- coroutine not defined
- pan; redrawing screen on every turn of travel

https://github.com/crawl/crawl/issues/4789 ->
  - drop_disables_autopickup blocks exclude-dropped.lua from working
  - crawl option cannot be toggled off
https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/4814 -> artificial cap on length blocks color-inscribe.lua
https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/4892 -> required for bread-swinger.lua
Shift-D drops both an item picked up with item:pickup(), and also the last picked up item.

### TODO - requirie crawl PR?
1. fully-recover:
  - Wait for allies to fully heal
  - Wait for ancestor respawn
1. Ancestor reappear; stop rest, but not explore
1. remove stat inscriptions and "~~DROP_ME" when dropping item (needs to inscribe items on floor)
1. colorize 'inscriptions' of artefacts (and 0.34's inscriptions of all items like scarf of resistance)
1. 0.34: Make use of explore_auto_rest_status to replace fully-recover.lua.
    (Issue: Trouble calling ready() after heal, before explore. Multiple annoyances when it's skipped.)
    (Maybe could fix with >1 ready() / turn... Try macro'ing: { WAIT, READY, EXPLORE }?)
1. Disable mouse click travel (on MacOS?) - ideally just prevent accidental movement from trackpad

### Backlog / Probably won't do
1. Speed improvements:
  - int instead of floats
  - extra level of 'items_alerted' table: item_db_name -> ego -> plus
  - bring back BRC.CACHE - ie load all values that are used >1x per ready().
    (Removed previous cache due to minimal impact, vs code clarity + robustness)
1. feature ready() hook takes optional bool to fire every ready() instead of every turn
1. BRC.mprf.color(msg, ...) and textf.color(msg, ...) that use string.format()
1. autorest starts w/autopickup (if inv not full)
1. level-specific fm ignores (eg vault warden on v:5)
1. disable basic jewellery pickup after configurable xl
