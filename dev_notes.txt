### 0.34 changes needed
1. Confirm damage / AC calcs haven't changed
1. Items get auto-"inscribed" now in resists menu (using new terse name)

### To do list
1. [BUG] explore after rest; not consistent (is queue'ing the explore flag)
1. [BUG] Arte items get extra inscriptions from autoinscribe.rc (need to add negative regex check)
1. Features:
  - Turncount profile: (disable autopickup, auto-display info for items in view)
  - Add macro to save skill targets & CONFIG values (by race or race+class)
  - Bread-swinger: https://github.com/gammafunk/dcss-rc/blob/master/speedrun_rest.lua
1. Prompt for Auto-actions:
  - On alert, prompt/offer to pickup item (or macro available)
  - On pickup, if safe(), offer to wear/wield item (or macro available)
  - On drop_inferior inscribe, if safe(), offer to drop item (or macro available)
1. In-game guided menu (change config, save settings, etc...)

### TODO - requiring crawl PR?
1. Wait for allies to fully heal
1. Bring back mute_swaps.lua - only show final inventory slots (needs to intercept msgs)
1. remove stat inscriptions and "~~DROP_ME" when dropping item (needs to inscribe items on floor)
1. colorize inscriptions of artefacts (arte inscriptions aren't part of `item.inscription`)
1. 0.34: Make use of explore_auto_rest_status to replace fully-recover.lua.
    (Issue: Trouble calling ready() after heal, before explore. Multiple annoyances when it's skipped.)
    (Try macro'ing: { WAIT, READY, EXPLORE })
1. If ancestor dead, apply a negative status (so resting will wait for it)
1. Disable mouse click travel (on MacOS?) - ideally just prevent accidental movement from trackpad
1. Ancestor reappear; stop rest, but not explore

### Won't do - random ideas
1. autorest starts w/autopickup (if inv not full)
1. level-specific fm ignores (eg vault warden on v:5)
1. disable jewellery pickup after configurable xl
1. disable pickup/alert of basic items (jewellery only?) after artefact of same type
1. Armour ego alerts: identify new egos or missing resistances (not just compared to cur inventory)
  - Not needed, since inventory now unlimited

### Design choices / simplifications
1. Coglin DPS calcs for non-wielded weapons evaluate as if swapping out primary weapon (for artefact stat changes)
