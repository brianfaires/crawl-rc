### todos / bugs?
- brighter colors for finding portal "staircase to the Shoals"
- turncount:
  - Flag glowing / un-id'd items: they're not autopickup until they're id'd
  - breadswing for negative statuses too?
  - Disable several hotkeys
  - breadswing bug:
    - only wall is NW, w/ battleaxe, item on ground NE


- remove race/class saves?
- hotkey def swallowing keypresses
- no announcement for steam dragon scales (same turn as lvl up and gained 1 lvl)
- no first of buckler alert when in a stack (autopickup disabled)

- mute:
  - your weapon "stops crackling"

- fully-recover:
  - test using CMD_WAIT vs CMD_REST; only use wait when maxhp? (else redraws every turn)
- pan; redrawing screen on every turn of travel

### crawl PRs / issues affecting BRC
https://github.com/crawl/crawl/issues/4789 ->
  - drop_disables_autopickup blocks exclude-dropped.lua from working
  - crawl option cannot be toggled off
https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/4814 -> artificial cap on length blocks color-inscribe.lua
https://github.com/crawl/crawl/pull/4892 -> required for bread-swinger.lua
Shift-D drops both an item picked up with item:pickup(), and also the last picked up item.

### TODO - require crawl PR?
1. fully-recover:
  - Wait for allies to fully heal
  - Wait for ancestor respawn
  - Capture in fully_recovered() to stop resting when this happens.
  - Make use of explore_auto_rest_status to replace fully-recover.lua.
    (Issue: Trouble calling ready() after heal, before explore. Multiple annoyances when it's skipped.)
    (Maybe could fix with >1 ready() / turn... Try macro'ing: { WAIT, READY, EXPLORE }?)
1. remove stat inscriptions and "~~DROP_ME" when dropping item (needs to inscribe items on floor)
1. colorize 'inscriptions' of artefacts (and 0.34's inscriptions of all items like scarf of resistance)
1. Disable mouse click travel (on MacOS?) - ideally just prevent accidental movement from trackpad
1. announce shop names/types as they come into view

### Backlog
1. Speed improvements:
  - int instead of floats
  - extra level of 'items_alerted' table: item_db_name -> ego -> plus
  - bring back BRC.CACHE - ie load all values that are used >1x per ready().
    (Removed previous cache due to minimal impact, vs code clarity + robustness)
1. BRC core/util:
  - feature ready() hook takes optional bool to fire every ready() instead of every turn
  - BRC.mprf.color(msg, ...) and textf.color(msg, ...) that use string.format()
1. Rest starts w/1 turn of autopickup (if inv not full)
1. alert-monsters:
  - level-specific fm ignores (eg vault warden on v:5)
  - torment helper; unique color / display count or list of tormentors in LOS
1. pickup-alert:
  - disable basic jewellery pickup after configurable xl
  - on pickup artefact jewellery with no downsides, disable autopickup of basic jewellery
